function [omega] = CriticalSpeed(diameter, forces, deflection)
% This function calculates the critical speeds of the loaded shafts
% Note: shaft struct has (position [micrometer], diameter [millimeter]), forces
% has (position [micrometer], force [N]), and deflection ()

w_shaft =       % shaft's intrinsic critical speed
